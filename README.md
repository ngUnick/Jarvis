# Jarvis Discord Bot

Jarvis is a simple and user-friendly Discord bot designed to engage in conversations using Microsoft's DialoGPT-large model from the Hugging Face library. Leveraging the Inference API, Jarvis acts as a basic chatbot capable of holding conversations with users in Discord servers.

Jarvis leverages Microsoft's "DialoGPT-large" NPL model from the Hugging Face library through the Inference API to understand and respond to users' input in a conversation.

## How to Use

- **Private Messages:** Send a direct/private message to Jarvis by clicking on the bot's name in the member list or typing `@Jarvis` in the Discord app's direct message section. Jarvis will respond to your queries or commands in private messages.

- **Adding Jarvis to Your Server:** To fully engage with Jarvis in your server's channels, invite the bot to your Discord server using the following invite link: [Invite Link](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1190353990861459486&permissions=534723950656&scope=bot)

- **Initiating Conversation:** After adding Jarvis to your server, start a conversation with the bot by tagging it with `@Jarvis` in any channel. Once Jarvis responds, you can continue the conversation by simply replying to its messages.
